** This is a practice using docker **
I created a basic API using Flask and Docker
 I use python 3.13, Flask, gunicorn and Docker

To build the image in docker:
    docker build -t api-flask .

To run the container:
    docker run -d -p 8080:5000 --name api-active api-flask

** I use the port 8080 because the port 5000 was already used **

To see the result check:
    http://localhost:8080/ and run docker ps to see if the container is active

To stop the container:
    docker stop api-active

To remove the container
    docker rm api-active
